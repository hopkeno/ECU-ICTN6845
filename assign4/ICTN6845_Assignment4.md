Deadline: Oct 6 (11:59 PM)

Create a web page that allows the users to create an account (a username and a password). There should be a login page that allows users to create an account by entering their preferred username and password. The same page should also let users login if they already have an account. If a user is logged in successfully , they should be able to enter a comment and also read the comments entered by others previously.

This assignment will build on what you already developed for the previous assignment. You will be just adding the login functionality on top of the previous work. 

Hint: To accomplish this task, you will need to create a new table that will store user names and passwords. That way you can authenticate the users who wants to login.  Chapter 12 is key for this assignment. You will be using cookies and/or sessions to complete this assignment.
